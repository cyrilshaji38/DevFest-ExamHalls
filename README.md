## How it Works ?

1. Institutes and Students can make an account.
2. Institutes offer exam hall seats at a fixed rate. They can also use their account to hold their own examinations and upload their question papers to classrooms.
3. Students can use the search page to look for exam halls nearby and book a seat for their examinations. During an examination the student must reach the exam hall where their attendence will be taken and they can write their whole test with the help of the classrooms page. Everything can be done within the app and the device will be proctored to prevent malpractices.
